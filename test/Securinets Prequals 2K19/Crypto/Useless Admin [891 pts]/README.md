Description:
One member of our team, piece of sh#t an#s_boss, made a huge mistake using multi time pad.

He knew that the OTP, if it is well applied, it is unbreakable.
But this usesless brainless retard, went yoloooo.

Not only that, but he deleted the original plain text, 
so we are screwed.

The only thing left is the following file : cipher.json

It contains multiple cipher text, created using OTP and the same key.

So can you figure out the plain text of the cipher_flag ?

Flag format : Securinets{plain text here}
