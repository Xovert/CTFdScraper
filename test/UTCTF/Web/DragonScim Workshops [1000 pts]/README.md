Description:
DragonScim is holding it's PKing workshop again! Word on the street is the admins get into the console via the **Contact**. They thought it might be clever and crafty if they also just created their name with inspiration from fish that **collide with themselves**. Oh, and lastly, they've left a joke for us. Here it is:


How do you kill a circus?   
You go for the juggler.  

Also, the admins love Maryland a lot... They've been there 5 times.    
   
NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN XSS CHALLENGE
