Description:
Eve is an Apple Employee who has access to the iMessage keystore (because there is nothing stopping them). They know Alice and Bob use iMessage instead of Signal, therefore they decrypted their messages and see that Alice has sent Bob a meme. Eve suspects more is going on. Can you confirm their suspicions?

We included a screenshot of the message, and the actual files sent in the iMessage chat.
