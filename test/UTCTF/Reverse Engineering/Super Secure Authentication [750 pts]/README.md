Description:
Lord Farquaad from Shrek decided that his castle needs better security, so he wrote a custom-made program to verify a given password. He used many layers of encoding and is very confident that you cannot figure out the password. 

To run the program, unzip the zip file and run ```java Authenticator [password]```.
